# Dc-and-Servo-Motor
# DC Motor
- This circuit is designed to control a DC motor using an Arduino Uno microcontroller. The circuit is created in Tinkercad, an online circuit simulator that allows users to design and simulate circuits virtually.
- The DC motor is controlled by a transistor switch circuit, which allows the Arduino to turn the motor on and off.
- The circuit consists of the following components:
1. Arduino Uno R3
2. 2 DC motor
3. Breadboard
4. L293D
5. Jumper wires
